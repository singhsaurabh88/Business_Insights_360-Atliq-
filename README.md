Problem Statement:

Atliq specializes in hardware sales across physical stores and online platforms. Our three-tiered sales channels (retailers, direct sales, and distributors) were facing challenges in Latin America due to intuition-based strategies. To combat this, we established a data analytics team to leverage factual data for strategic decisions.
Technologies Used:

    SQL: Loaded data from SQL dump into MySQL and Power BI.
    Power BI: Used for visualization, modeling, and real-time analytics.
    Dax Studio: Applied for query optimization and performance monitoring.

Key Reports and Views:

    Finance View: Analyzed Net Invoice Sales, Gross Margin %, and Net Profit to identify sales trends and customer/product performance.

    Sales View: Examined sales performance by region, customer, and product category for strategic business insights.

    Marketing View: Evaluated product performance across regions, markets, and customer segments, focusing on Net Profit metrics.

    Supply Chain View: Provided insights into inventory management and product availability percentages.

    Executive View: Quick insights into divisional performance, key KPIs, market share, and competitor comparisons.

Key Technical Learnings:

    Data Loading and Transformation: Loaded MySQL data into Power BI, transformed data using Power Query, and created calculated columns.

    Data Modeling: Utilized DAX for measures, implemented various relationships, and understood OLTP vs. OLAP.

    Dashboard Design: Applied effective design principles for visually appealing dashboards.

    User Feedback and Updates: Incorporated stakeholder feedback, implemented dynamic slicers, and toggled between visuals.

    Deployment and Automation: Published reports, created workspaces, and set up automatic data refresh using personal/organizational gateways and Microsoft SharePoint.
